# BrainBytes Performance Guidelines

## Performance Baselines
- Average API Response Time: < 200ms
- 95th Percentile Response Time: < 500ms
- API Error Rate: < 1%
- Average CPU Usage: < 40%
- Average Memory Usage: < 60%

## Common Performance Issues and Solutions

### Slow API Response Times
- **Symptoms**: Average response time exceeds 300ms
- **Potential Causes**: 
  - Database query inefficiency
  - AI model processing delays
  - Resource contention
- **Solutions**:
  - Check database indexes
  - Optimize AI model loading
  - Scale container resources

### High Error Rates
- **Symptoms**: Error rate exceeds 2%
- **Potential Causes**:
  - Service unavailability
  - Input validation issues
  - Resource exhaustion
- **Solutions**:
  - Check service health
  - Validate request patterns
  - Review resource allocation

## Performance Testing Procedures
1. Run baseline tests weekly
2. Conduct load tests before major releases
3. Monitor performance metrics continuously
4. Document performance regressions
