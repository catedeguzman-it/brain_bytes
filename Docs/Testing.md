# BrainBytes Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the BrainBytes AI Tutoring Platform.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing
- **Frontend**: Test individual React components in isolation
- **Backend**: Test individual functions and utilities

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints
- Test database interactions

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows (future implementation)

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Main testing framework for both frontend and backend
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Supertest**: For testing API endpoints

## Code Quality

- **ESLint**: Static code analysis for JavaScript
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI pipeline for running tests

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Write tests as you code**: Add tests when implementing new features
2. **Focus on critical paths**: Prioritize testing key functionality
3. **Keep tests simple**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
4. **Use descriptive names**: Test names should clearly explain what is being tested
5. **Maintain independence**: Tests should not depend on other tests

## Future Enhancements

- Add end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress
- Implement code coverage reporting
- Add performance testing
